# AdaptiveGPT

Adaptive learning consists of an educational methodology that allows the personalization of learning according to the pedagogical path that the student follows during their interaction with the topic presented by the teacher. In digital environments, adaptive learning proposals must be dynamic enough to understand the context, generate activities, and understand the correctness of the questions. Therefore, this work proposes using a large language model that can assist in the automatic creation of activities in an adaptive model, which can dynamically adjust according to students' actions on such activities. A proof of concept was developed, and its usability was evaluated. The results showed that our proposal is adaptable enough to be implemented in face-to-face pedagogical practices and virtual learning environments.
